# William-1st-Portfolio

For this assignment I was told to create my very own portfolio, the portfolio needed to have a section for projects, about me, and a contact me section which I have included. 

The acceptance criteria for this project was 
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

whilst i tried my best to make all acceptance criteria possible the only one I seemed to have an issue with was the resizing the page to different devices. To view the live version of this repository [click here](https://liamz34.github.io/William-1st-Portfolio/)
